# React challenge JungleDev!

This project was developed by Thiago Tavares, as technical challenge for JungleDevs. The objective was to replicate a ready-made design shared through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iBxoiuoSXy3SiOAnwXo2Np/Frontend-%E2%80%93-Challenge-1).

## Instructions to run the development build

1.  Open terminal in path folder that you want to clone

2.  Clone repo
  - `git clone `
3.  Enter the repo folder you just clone

  - `cd jungle-challenge`

4.  Install the dependencies
  - `npm install`

5.  start the project 
  - `npm start`
## Instructions to create a production build

1. Open terminal in project path folder
2. Run build command
   - `npm run build`

Then you'll have a production ready build in the `build` folder.
This method correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
